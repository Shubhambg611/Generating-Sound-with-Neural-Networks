Project Overview
Welcome to our Music Generation project! This project utilizes deep learning techniques to generate music compositions. The goal is to create unique and harmonious pieces of music by training a neural network on a dataset of musical patterns.

Features
Deep Learning Model: We employ a deep neural network architecture to learn the patterns and structures present in the input musical data.

Dataset: The model is trained on a diverse dataset of musical compositions, allowing it to capture a wide range of musical styles and genres.
